# COS 583 Final Project: Rust NES Emulator

NES emulator written as my final project for COS 583 "Great Moments in Computing"

Features include:

- Accurate CPU emulator
- PPU Emulator
- NROM Cartridge Mapping
- INES file parsing
- 2 player controller support

I only had a few weeks to make this happen so there are a few features that you might notice are conspicuously absent. The most obvious is audio emulation. However, singing is always recommended.
